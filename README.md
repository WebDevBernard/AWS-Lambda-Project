## About

- This data is an estimate of weekly Mythic+ runs based on character count. It uses data from Raider.io API in lieu of an official count from Blizzard.

- This app is based on this [r/wow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/o5nocw/comment/h2ov91n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) post. It uses the same logic to get data and is automated using AWS.
